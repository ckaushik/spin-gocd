**WARNING!** This code is intended as an example that you can copy and use, rather than a supported module that you should import. I reserve the right to completely change it in dangerous and destructive ways, with complete disregard for backwards compatibility. Also, I make no guarantees that this code works as is. There's a pretty good chance that it's broken, due to neglect or different usage.
